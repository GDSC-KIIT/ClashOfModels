          <p>
            Our tech genies, Anindyadeep Sannigrahi and Pratyush Patnaik, have come up with a low code platform called "rewards.ai" to help newbies experiment with Reinforcement Learning. The product is our original SDK, which allows users to go one
            step further in customising their models using our Python library.
            In the Rewards Platform, users do not have to worry about
            programming anything, and can put focus completely on building their
            model. This platform is an original creation and we are super excited for its debut on 22nd. And, we hope that you guys will be there for it!

            The primary objective for Clash of Models is to help people grasp
            the basics of artificial intelligence. We’ve got you even if you
            don’t know much about AI.

          <p>
            There will be a brief session from 11AM which will help you grasp
            the fundamentals of AI, following which, we will have a
            mini-hackathon. The event is likely to end by 5PM

        <DisclosureComponent heading={"Is there a fee or is the event free?"}>
          <p>
            There is absolutely no fee for registering and participating. All we
            want is for people to come and enjoy while learning something new.

            "What is the winning criteria?"
          }
        >
          <p>
          The winning criteria totally depends on whether the participant's car can finish till the end of the race track or not. If we observe that none of the participants are able to finish off the race track then we will evaluate based on which car has driven farthest in the evaluation race track. If we see several  participants are able to finish to the end of track then we will evaluate on the time required to finish the track.
