            Like all our other events, DevSprint is also free-of-cost and you
            donâ€™t need to pay anything to register for it. We plan to keep all
            of our future events free too.

            The entirety of your idea need not be fully implemented. However,
            the submission should be functional so that it can be reviewed by
            the judges.

          <p>
            Any language. Make sure you constantly update your GitHub repository
            comprising your project and submit its link. Update the README.md
            with all the details about your application and the instructions to
            run the code.

            The developer(s) will have all the rights to own the IP of the
            product. However, all the code needs to be in the public domain
            (open source) as mentioned earlier. so that it can be thoroughly
            evaluated by the judges.
